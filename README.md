Hello everyone, This application aims to assist cocoa farmers in making early diagnoses of their cocoa plants' conditions by allowing them to upload photos of their cocoa plants. The system will then classify cacao diseases based on the uploaded photos, and provide information on how to prevent and treat the identified diseases. Developed by the C23-PC638 team which consists of 6 members who contribute to their respective fields. The machine learning team is tasked with creating an algorithm that is used to predict types of diseases in cocoa plants. The cloud computing team is responsible for building relationships between the machine learning team and the mobile development team. Meanwhile, mobile development is responsible for creating interfaces and interactions with users. This project is part of our final Project Capstone at Bangkit Academy 2023 led by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka
